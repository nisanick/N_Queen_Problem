N-Queen problem:
You are tasked to place N queens on a NxN chessboard in a way that no two queens are able to attack each other. How many ways solutions are there for N queens?

Since the problem is recursive in nature, my solution provided here is made without use of recursion to show that most obvious solution is not the only one.
